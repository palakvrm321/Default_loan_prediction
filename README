# Project Overview-
Loan default prediction is a critical task in the financial sector to assess credit risk and minimize losses. This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Apache Spark to develop a scalable and accurate predictive model that identifies potential loan defaulters, enabling better risk management and decision-making for lenders.

# Objectives
- Load and explore loan and borrower datasets from multiple financial sources.
- Preprocess and engineer features into formats suitable for ML modeling.
- Build and evaluate multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost).
- Utilize Apache Spark MLlib for efficient large-scale processing and model training.
- Integrate the workflow for potential real-time risk scoring in a loan approval system.

# Key Features
- End-to-end pipeline: 
Data collection, preprocessing, EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- Scalability:
Built using Apache Spark for handling large volumes of financial data.
- Multiple algorithms:
Comparison of advanced models, emphasizing handling class imbalance (using SMOTE).
- Performance metrics: 
Evaluation based on accuracy and recall to identify the best-suited model for default detection. 

# Technologies Used
